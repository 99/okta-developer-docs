title: Create custom scopes
---

The Client Credentials flow never has a user context, so you can't request OpenID scopes. Instead, you must create a custom scope. See the **Scopes** section of the [Create a Custom Authorization Server](/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/create-scopes/) guide for more information on creating custom scopes.
