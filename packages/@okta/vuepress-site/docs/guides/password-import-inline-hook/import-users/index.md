Upload some users into your Okta org using the [Password Import Inline Hook API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook). These users provide data to test your inline hook.

The example below uses sample data from the data store in the `users.js` file of your project.
