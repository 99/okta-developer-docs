title: Set up and extend the sample SAML app
---

The Spring Security + SAML and Database Authentication application is designed to demonstrate SAML authentication using an Okta org as an IdP. This guide extends this application workflow to introduce a SAML Assertion Hook using a Node.js Express external service.

Access the Spring Security + SAML and Database Authentication code from the following Github repository:

[https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-security-saml-db-example](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-security-saml-db-example)

Follow the [README.md](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-security-saml-db-example/blob/master/README.md) instructions to install and run the Okta-Hosted-Login sample application with your Okta org. Make sure to have this application running before proceeding with the SAML Assertion Inline Hook setup.
